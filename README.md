# WELCOME to my card-game-project

This was my second react project!

It is a pretty basic project in which I was still learning class components and not using global state.

This was a project I developed in the Trybe Course.

The Project is a simple card creator of a common and famous game in Brasil called Super Trunfo, where the players uses the attributes of each card to duel with each other.

In this project I used some habilities to create components and filter.

Notes:

All codes inside the Components folder and also the App, Index and CSS were developed by me.

All the data about Peaky Blinders were found in the internet and don't necessarily represent any truth from the series. It was just a theme particularly choose by me.

The ESlint were provided by Trybe (the school witch I'm studying).

Thanks a lot for taking a look! you're very welcome to spy on all my others repositories!
